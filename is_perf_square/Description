is_perfect_square, accepts a number and returns True if it's a perfect square and False if it's not. A perfect square is any number which has an integer square root. So 25 is a perfect square but 24 is not, 9 is a perfect square but 8 is not, 100 is a perfect square but 1000 is not.

Here's an example:

>>> is_perfect_square(64)
True
>>> is_perfect_square(65)
False
>>> is_perfect_square(100)
True
>>> is_perfect_square(1000)
False

make sure that this function raises a TypeError when an invalid type is given (integers and floats are fine but strings aren't)
